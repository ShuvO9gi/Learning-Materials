General Technique:
1. Create element with HTML
2. Style with CSS one-by-one

There are three types of elements:
    1. block element(takes up the whole container space)
    2. inline-block(only takes up as much space as needed)
    3. inline element(appear within a line of text)

<div> is a block element. div means division

There are two types of layout:
    1. Vertical Layout
        use a div element because div is a block element which makes a vertical layout by default.
    2. Horizontal Layout
        use a div element but change its display to inline-block which makes a horizontal layout.

> image will always overflow its container border if we doesn't declare its size(width). So, declare
    image size(width/height) to 100% or below its container width(size)
