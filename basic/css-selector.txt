> Space(descendant selector)
    div.class_name a {
        //all <a> inside this class_name
    }

> [> Sign](child selector):
    div#id_name > a {
        //Only those <a> which are direct child of this class_name
    }

> For +(plus) and ~(tilde)
    both element must have to be under same parent
        in case of +(plus), second element must have to be immediately after the first element
        in case of ~(tilde), for second element it is not mandatory to be immediately after the first element
> [+ (plus) Sign](Adjacent sibling combinator):
    combines two sequences of simple selectors having the same parent and the second one must come IMMEDIATELY after the first.
    It selects all the elements that are adjacent siblings of specified elements. It selects the second element
     if it immediately follows the first element. 

    It selects h4 tags that immediately follow the ul tag.
    ul+h4 {
      border: 4px solid red;
    }

> [~ (tilde) Sign](general sibling combinator):
    similar to Adjacent sibling combinator. The difference is that the second selector does NOT have to immediately follow 
    the first one means It will select all elements that is preceded by the former selector.
    Example:
    //Changes to the span element content which follows paragraph tag and both have same parent tag. 
        p~span {
        color: red;
        }

        <p>learn</p>
        <span>Last span tag.</span> //this will be selected
        <span>Secind span tag.</span> //this will also be selected
        </body>

> Universal Selector:
    universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.

> Grouping Selector:
    To group selectors, separate each selector with a comma.
    h1, h2, p{}

> id(#) selector

> class(.) selector

> Element Selector:
    element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name (or tag) for example p, h1, div, span, etc.

> Attribute Selector:
    [attribute_name] {//will be applied to each and every HTML element on the page}

    Example:
        input[type="checkbox"] {
            background: orange;
        }

        a[href="url_name"] {
                        background: yellow;
                    }

> Pseudo-Element Selector(::):
    Selector:Pseudo-Element{//used to style any specific part of the element}
    p::first-line{//will be applied for the first line of any p element}

> Pseudo-Class Selector(:):
    Selector:Pseudo-Element{//used to tyle a special type of state of any element}
    a:visited{//will be applied a element when it is visited}

> Wildcard Selectors (*, ^ and $):
    [attribute*=”str”] Selector: select that elements whose attribute value contains(first/last/middle) the specified sub string str.
    [attribute^=”str”] Selector: select those elements whose attribute value begins with a specified value str. 
    [attribute$=”str”] Selector: select those elements whose attribute value ends with a specified value str.
