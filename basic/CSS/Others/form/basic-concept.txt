> label:
    <label> must be equal to the id attribute of the related element to bind them together.
    Users who have difficulty clicking on very small regions (such as checkboxes) - 
    because when a user clicks the text within the <label> element, it toggles the input (this increases the hit area).

    label can be used as attribute of an element & it will be showed to the browser(like <optgroup label="label_example">
    or <option label="label_example">)

> name & value:
    In <input />, name & value attribute are used. So that, when we submit the form, name & value also submitted.
    Incase of input(type="text), if you want to set some default value then write it on value attribute(like value="Default Value").
    But if we leave it blank then user written text will be submitted.

    For <option> or radio button, value is defined as default value. If attribute value is blank("") or attribute value is not mentioned
    but innertext is given then when form is submitted it will treated as value.

> input element has 

> form(attribute) can be used in label & textarea to define which <form> it will be used for by using id(attribute) in the <form>
