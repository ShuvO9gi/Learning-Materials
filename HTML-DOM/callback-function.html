      <h1>When to Use the Callback Function</h1>
      Javascript is a <strong>single-threaded</strong> language, which means, it
      executes the code sequentially one line after another.<br />
      JavaScript runs code sequentially in top-down order. However, there are
      some cases that code runs (or must run) after something else happens and
      also not sequentially. This is called asynchronous programming. <br />
      Callbacks make sure that a function is not going to run before a task is
      completed but will run right after the task has completed. It helps us
      develop asynchronous JavaScript code and keeps us safe from problems and
      errors. <br />
      In JavaScript, the way to create a callback function is to pass it as a
      parameter to another function, and then to call it back right after
      something has happened or some task is completed.
      <p>
        Indeed, callbacks are most often used with asynchronous functions. A
        typical example is JavaScript setTimeout().

      <h2>Arrow function</h2>
      <p style="line-height: 1.5">
        We can write an arrow function in this format like.. <br />
        <i><b>let arrrowFunc = () => { return "Hello World!"; }</b></i> <br />
        or let arrrowFunc = () => {console.log("Hello World!");} //Though we
        didn't use return keyword but there will be no error because
        console.log() implicitly return something. Still if we use
        console.log(arrowFunc()) we will get some undefined result because if we
        don't use return keyword, hiddenly it's value was set as undefined.
        <br />
        or let arrrowFunc = () => { console.log("Hello World!"); return "Hello
        World!"; } //in this case undefined problem will be eliminated. <br />
        <br />
        if we had <strong>only one statement</strong> then we can eliminate
        curly braces and return keyword like.. <br />
        let arrowFunc = () => "Hello World"!; or () => "Hello World!"; <br />
        <br />
        but we can't write it as below though it has only one statement because
        we use curly braces it doesn't return anything. So there will be an
        error. <br />
        let arrrowFunc = () => { "Hello World!";} <br />
        or () => return "Hello World!"; (it doesn't has curly braces.)
