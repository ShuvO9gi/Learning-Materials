      <h1>HTML Collection & Nodelist</h1>
      <h2>The Difference Between an HTMLCollection and a NodeList</h2>
      A NodeList and an HTMLcollection is very much the same thing.<br />
      Both are array-like collections (lists) of nodes (elements) extracted from
      a document.<br />
      The nodes can be accessed by index numbers. The index starts at 0.<br />
      Both have a length property that returns the number of elements in the
      list (collection).<br />
      An HTMLCollection is a collection of document elements. A NodeList is a
      collection of document nodes (element nodes, attribute nodes, and text
      nodes).<br />
      HTMLCollection items can be accessed by their name, id, or index
      number.<br />
      NodeList items can only be accessed by their index number.<br />
      An HTMLCollection is always a live collection. Example: If you add a *li
      element to a list in the DOM, the list in the HTMLCollection will also
      change.<br />
      A NodeList is most often a static collection. Example: If you add a *li
      element to a list in the DOM, the list in NodeList will not change.<br />
      The getElementsByClassName() and getElementsByTagName() methods return a
      live HTMLCollection.<br />
      The querySelectorAll() method returns a static NodeList. <br />
      The childNodes property returns a live NodeList.
